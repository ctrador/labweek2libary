 # Command Line Programs
 The primary technique that we have used so far to learn about programming Swift has been the Swift Playground, which has been nice, since it allows us to quickly write the code, have it compiled and run for us on the fly.
 
 However the primary drawback is the code is has to remain very simple and the there really isn't any good way to interact with the user.  In other words in a playground, you can't ask a user to provide input without having that user change the code.
 
 So we're going to try something a little more complex by starting to use a new type of project called a Swift command line application.  This is still written within Xcode, but has a slightly different layout.  The end result will be an application that will be able to ask questions in text and you can type in a response.
 
 It has the additional benefit of allowing for creating different files for classes and having a better debugger!
